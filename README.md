PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 


ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS USED:
⦁	Ultrasonic sensor HC- SR04 (x2)
⦁	Arduino Uno R3
⦁	16X2 LCD Display JHD 162A
⦁	MCU Node (Only used to upload the count on internet)
⦁	DC Adapter for power supply
CKT DIAGRAM:
 
(Software used to make the circuit- Tinker Cad)



ADDITIONAL FEATURES ADDED TO THE DESCRIPTION:
⦁	We have made the design to for a bi-directional visitor counter and hence it counts people entering as well as the people who are leaving the room.
⦁	Along with the LCD Display we have added a Wi-Fi module using Node MCU which uploads the count on adafruit.io which can be used by a user who is far away from the door (or maybe even the room) to check the count of people without having to reach the door to have a look at the Display.

IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE IN THE PROJECT:
⦁	The sensitivity of the project can be increased significantly if instead of ultrasonic sensors, long-range IR sensors are used (which are too expensive for this project) or a camera is used to implement object detection.
⦁	Alarm can be added to the project to detect human activity at unusual hours.
